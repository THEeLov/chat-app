# 💬 Chat Application - Frontend

This is the frontend of the real-time chat application, built using **React**. It communicates with the backend to allow real-time messaging between users and displays their online status. Application is not responsive for now, maybe will be fixed in future.

## 🌐 Live Demo

This apps backend is deployed on **Render**. Please note that when the app has been inactive for a while, backend enters **sleep mode**. This means the apps backend might take a few extra seconds/minutes to start when you attempt to do some request (like login/register).
